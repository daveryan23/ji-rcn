Just Intonation - Rational Comma Notation

**Just Intonation** (JI) is a system of musical tuning where intervals can be expressed as ratios between whole numbers.

Examples include: an octave (1:2), a major fourth (3:4), a major triad (4:5:6).

The reason to use Just Intonation is that it is the natural system of tuning for harmonic instruments such as stringed instruments, wind instruments, and the human voice itself.

Unlike the contemporary scale of 12-tone equal temperament (12TET), there are an infinite number of notes available in JI. This is why a notation system is important to have, that can cope with any possible ratio between whole numbers. Such a system is **Rational Comma Notation**, developed by David Ryan between 2015 and 2018. This system [is documented in this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01860).

The purpose of this npm package is to make available calculations related to converting between rational numbers and these notations from RCN.
